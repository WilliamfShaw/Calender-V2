Simple calendar written using ES6, HTML, CSS

Approach:

Practice with Vanilla JS objects and DOM manipulation. I decided to use HTML to build out the core structure of the calendar and populate it with information gathered from the Calendar class. Since the body table is dynamic it is always rendered with JS.

To run locally:

 `git clone`
 `cd Calender-V2`
 `open index.html`
